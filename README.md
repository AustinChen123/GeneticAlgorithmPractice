# Genetic Algorithm Project (2021)

This repository contains a backup of a project from 2021, featuring a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm. The project draws inspiration from the classic problem, "If I had 1 million NT dollars," and applies genetic algorithms to historical stock data to find the optimal diversified investment portfolio. The stock data is sourced from TEJ Taiwan Economic Journal ([TEJ website](https://www.tejwin.com/)).
